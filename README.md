# Deep_learning_ANN
This study explores the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in predicting customer churn in a telecom industry dataset. The dataset comprises various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and service preferences. Through extensive preprocessing and feature engineering, an ANN model is developed to classify customers as churners or non-churners. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy producing 83.36 % accuracy that can be increased by using fine-tuning methods. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ANN in accurately predicting customer churn, thereby aiding telecom companies in implementing proactive retention strategies.
